### Welcome to my homepage!
Hello, I'm Shuo Wang, a first-year Ph.D. student from [Department of Mathematics](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/) of City University of Hong Kong from Sep. 2023, under the supervision of Prof. [Wing Cheong LO](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/wingclo.htm). My research interest lies in Mathematical biology.

My email is swang666-c@my.cityu.edu.hk or surwing912@gmail.com, and my workstation is in Room 1392 of Fong Yun-Wah Building. Please contact me if you find any mistakes in my notes, and comments are welcome. Thanks in advance for your attention.



### Personal notes/slides

#### Notes
* (Last updated in Dec. 2023)[Functional Analysis Note](notes/Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras/functional analysis note.pdf). This is a lecture note on Functional Analysis lectured by Prof. [MERTZ Laurent](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/laurent-mertz.htm). I will update advanced topics in functional analysis to this note when I'm available.
* (Last updated in Feb. 2024)[Review of Topology](notes/Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras/review of topology.pdf). This note is a quick review of topology, including point set topology and algebraic topology. I will finish the first part about point set topology this month, and update algebraic topology when I'm available.
* (Last updated in Feb. 2024)[PDE note](notes/Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras/PDE note.pdf). This is a lecture note on PDE lectured by Prof. [Tao LUO](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/taoluo.htm). The main topics in this note are Sobolev Spaces, Second-Order Elliptic Equations, and Linear Evolution Equations. The main reference is [Lawrence C. Evans](https://math.berkeley.edu/~evans/)' book: [Partial Differential Equations](https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-19-r/), and [Gerald B. Folland](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~folland/Homepage/index.html)'s book: [Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Analysis-Modern-Techniques-Applications/dp/0471317160).


#### Slides
* (Last updated Feb. 2024)[Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras](notes/Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras/correspondence.pdf). I typed this slide to give a basic introduction to manifold theory, Lie theory (including Lie groups, Lie algebras, and fundamental theorems), and some simple applications to ODE systems. The main references are Frank W. Warner's book: [Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-1799-0), and [John M. Lee](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~lee/)'s book: [Introduction to Smooth Manifolds](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9982-5).
