### Welcome to my homepage!
Hello, I'm Shuo Wang, a first-year Ph.D. student from the Department of Mathematics of City University of Hong Kong form Sep. 2023, under the supervision of Wing Cheong LO. My research interest lies in Mathematical biology.
My email is swang666-c@my.cityu.edu.hk or surwing912@gmail.com, and my workstation is in Room 1392 of Fong Yun-Wah Building. Please contact me if you find any mistakes in my notes, and comments are welcome. Thanks in advance for your attention.

### Seminars
* (2023Fall)A  [seminar](notes/2023Fall/toric/syllabus.pdf) about toric variety, and here are some lecture notes: [09-23](notes/2023Fall/toric/09-23.pdf), [10-07](notes/2023Fall/toric/10-07.pdf), [10-28](notes/2023Fall/toric/10-28.pdf), [11-11](notes/2023Fall/toric/11-11.pdf), [11-18](notes/2023Fall/toric/11-18.pdf), [12-30](notes/2023Fall/toric/12-30,01-07.pdf), [1-07](notes/2023Fall/toric/12-30,01-07.pdf).
* (2023Spring)[Principal bundle and its application](notes/2023Spring/geometry_of_principal_bundle.pdf). In this lecture, firstly we introduce principal bundle and connections on it, the most important ingredients of this part are local computations. Then we introduce its applications on Chern-Weil theory.
* (2022Fall) Here are the lecture notes of talks I gave in a seminar about Bott-Tu's [GTM82](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-3951-0), which is organized by [chenglong yu](https://chenglongyu.github.io/),
   - [Čech cohomology](notes/2022Fall/Cech_cohomology.pdf).
   - [Spectral sequence and its application](notes/2022Fall/Spectral_sequence.pdf).
 * (2022Summer, last updated 2023/01/30) Here is the draft of lecture note I typed for a seminar about [commutative algebra](notes/2022Summer/commutative_algebra.pdf).


### Course notes
* (2023Fall)[Algebraic curve](notes/2023Fall/algebraic_curve.pdf), lectured by [chenglong yu](https://chenglongyu.github.io/).



### Personal notes/slides
#### Notes
* (Last updated 2023/09/12)[Symmetric space](notes/personal notes/symmetric_space.pdf). It's a note I typed about symmetric space, and the main reference is the [textbook](https://books.google.com.hk/books/about/Differential_Geometry_Lie_Groups_and_Sym.html?id=DWGvsa6bcuMC&redir_esc=y) written by Sigurdur Helgason.
* (Last updated 2023/10/13)[Complex geometry I](notes/personal notes/Complex_geometry_I/Complex_geometry_I.pdf). It's a lecture note about complex differential geometry. The initial draft of this note is taken in 2022Spring, in the course about Hodge theory taught by [Qizheng Yin](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~qizheng/#), and that's my first time to learn this beautiful theory. Later in 2023Spring I added more useful techniques and advanced topics (such as Schwarz computations, Calabi-Yau theorem and so on) I learnt in the course “advanced topics in complex geometry" given by Xiaokui Yang. I also added some other materials from classical books to make this note self-contained.

#### Slides
* (2023/09/22)[Curvatures of left-invariant metrics on Lie groups](notes/personal notes/Curvatures_of_Lie_group.pdf). It's a slide about curvature properties of left-invariant metrics on Lie groups, and the main reference is Milnor's [paper](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/article?mr=0425012).


### TA
* (2024Winter)[Review of Algebra1](https://bowenl.notion.site/2024-02-1-44163401a7dd4cf28aa86264640464b5)
* (2023Fall)Solutions of homework of [Algebra1](notes/2023Fall/Solutions_to_HW.pdf)
* (2023Spring, last updated 2023/08/18)Lecture note of [Algebra-2H](notes/2023Spring/Algebra2-H.pdf), Shihao Wang also made a contribution to the Chapter11 of this note.
   - [Solutions to homework 1/3/5/7](notes/2023Spring/Solutions(1_3_5_7).pdf).
   - [Solutions to homework 9/11/13](notes/2023Spring/Solutions(9_11_13).pdf).
