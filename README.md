### Welcome to my homepage!
Hello, I'm Shuo Wang, a second-year Ph.D. student from [Department of Mathematics](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/) of [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk) from Sep. 2023, under the supervision of Prof. [Wing Cheong LO](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/wingclo.htm). My research interest lies in Mathematical biology, and I am particularly interested in applying differential equation models (i.e., ODE and dynamical systems, PDE, SDE (stochastic), functional or delay differential equations with bifurcation tools) to study cancer problems.

I'm also interested in updating personal notes in pure math, with topics including:

Analysis: (1: Fourier Analysis and Sobolev Spaces, 2: Measure Theory, 3: Stochastic Analysis, 4: Dynamical System, 5: Functional Analysis).

Algebra: (1: Lie Groups and Lie algebras, 2: Commutative Algebra, 3: Homological Algebra, 4: Category Theory, 5: Representation Theory (Mainly about Representations of Finite Groups)).

Geometry and Topology: (1: Manifold Theory, 2: Algebraic Topology, 3: Algebraic Geometry).

My email is swang666-c@my.cityu.edu.hk or surwing912@gmail.com, and my workstation is in Room 1392 of Fong Yun-Wah Building. Please contact me if you find any mistakes in my notes, and comments are welcome. Thanks in advance for your attention.


### CV
* (Last updated in Dec. 2022) You can find my [CV] here. I haven't updated my postgraduate background, and am considering updating my CV when available.


### Graduation Thesis
* (Last updated in May. 2022)[The universal covering group of SO(3) and its applications in representation theory](notes/Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras/graduation thesis.pdf). It gives an introduction to the universal covering group SU(2) of SO(3), (to be precise, double covering group): SU(2) is the double covering space of SO(3): SU(2) is the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$, SO(3) is the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$. When considering the Lie group structure, SU(2) becomes the universal covering group of SO(3). The finite subgroups of SO(3) are known, and it is given by the [Mckay correspondence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADE_classification); we then can use the double covering relation to find the finite subgroups of SU(2). At last, the class of irreducible representations of SU(2) is known, and we also use the double covering relation to find the class of irreducible representations of SO(3).


### Personal notes/slides

#### Notes
* (Last updated in Dec. 2023)[Functional Analysis Note](notes/Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras/functional analysis note.pdf). This is a lecture note on Functional Analysis lectured by Prof. [MERTZ Laurent](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/laurent-mertz.htm). I will update advanced topics in functional analysis to this note when I'm available.
* (Last updated in Feb. 2024)[Review of Topology](notes/Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras/review of topology.pdf). This note is a quick review of topology, including point set topology and algebraic topology. I will finish the first part about point set topology this month, and update algebraic topology when I'm available.
* (Last updated in Feb. 2024)[PDE note](notes/Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras/PDE note.pdf). This is a lecture note on PDE lectured by Prof. [Tao LUO](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/taoluo.htm). The main topics in this note are Sobolev Spaces, Second-Order Elliptic Equations, and Linear Evolution Equations. The main reference is [Lawrence C. Evans](https://math.berkeley.edu/~evans/)' book: [Partial Differential Equations](https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-19-r/), and [Gerald B. Folland](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~folland/Homepage/index.html)'s book: [Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Analysis-Modern-Techniques-Applications/dp/0471317160).

#### Slides
* (Last updated Feb. 2024)[Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras](notes/Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras/correspondence.pdf). I typed this slide to give a basic introduction to manifold theory, Lie theory (including Lie groups, Lie algebras, and fundamental theorems), and some simple applications to ODE systems. The main references are Frank W. Warner's book: [Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-1799-0), and [John M. Lee](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~lee/)'s book: [Introduction to Smooth Manifolds](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9982-5).
