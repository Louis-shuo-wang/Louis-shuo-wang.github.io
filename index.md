### Welcome to my homepage!
Hello, I'm Shuo Wang, a Ph.D. candidate from Department of Mathematics of [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk) from Sep. 2023, under the supervision of Prof. [Wing Cheong LO](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/wingclo.htm). My research interest lies in applying math tools to solve biological problems, e.g., cancer research. My email is surwing912@gmail.com. Feel free to get in touch with me if you have any kind of ideas, and thanks in advance for your attention.

### Graduation Thesis
* (Last updated in May. 2022)[The universal covering group of SO(3) and its applications in representation theory](notes/graduation thesis.pdf). It gives an introduction to the universal covering group SU(2) of SO(3), (to be precise, double covering group): SU(2) is the double covering space of SO(3): SU(2) is the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$, SO(3) is the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$. When considering the Lie group structure, SU(2) becomes the universal covering group of SO(3). The finite subgroups of SO(3) are known, and it is given by the [Mckay correspondence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADE_classification); we then can use the double covering relation to find the finite subgroups of SU(2). At last, the class of irreducible representations of SU(2) is known, and we also use the double covering relation to find the class of irreducible representations of SO(3).


### Slides
* (Last updated Feb. 2024)[Correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras](notes/correspondence.pdf). I typed this slide to give a basic introduction to manifold theory, Lie theory (including Lie groups, Lie algebras, and fundamental theorems), and some simple applications to ODE systems. The main references are Frank W. Warner's book: [Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-1799-0), and [John M. Lee](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~lee/)'s book: [Introduction to Smooth Manifolds](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9982-5).


### Conferences and Summer School

#### Conferences
* (19th - 22nd Jun. 2024)[PolyU-SJTU Joint Conference on Mathematical Biology – Models and Analysis](https://events.polyu.edu.hk/polyusjtu/home). This Mathematical Biology Conference is organized at the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong between 19th and 22nd Jun. 2024. The goal of this conference is to bring together the experts around the world on mathematical biology to enhance communication and foster research collaboration. Through various research talks reporting the progresses made on the modeling, analysis, experiments and field surveys, the conference aims to provide a platform to exchange mutual ideas, identify cutting-edge research topics and foster high-quality collaborations in the field of mathematical biology, as well as to get a panoramic view of the research development in this field. You can find some photos from that meeting below:

* (8th - 30th Jul. 2024)[Summer School on Applied Mathematics in Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/amel/sqxx/157587.htm). This summer school is a training program for interdisciplinary academic elites. Interdisciplinary research is the mainstream direction of scientific research in the world, and this program is based on the requirements of interdisciplinary development. By inviting well-known scholars in this field at home and abroad to give lectures, the course syllabus of this summer school covers the fields of scientific computing, machine learning, mathematical optimization, stochastic analysis, and artificial intelligence. The syllabus of the four courses can be found [here](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/amel/sqxx/157568.htm).
